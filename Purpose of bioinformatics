Bioinformatics is used to analyze and interpret large biological data sets, particularly genetic and genomic information, to understand biological processes, identify disease-related genes, develop new drugs, study evolution, and predict protein structures, 
essentially bridging the gap between biology and computer science by using computational tools to analyze complex biological data. 

Key applications of bioinformatics include:

Genome sequencing and analysis: Analyzing large DNA sequences to identify genes, mutations, and variations. 

Protein structure prediction: Predicting the 3D structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequence, which is crucial for drug design. 

Gene expression analysis: Studying how genes are turned on or off in different conditions. 

Evolutionary studies: Comparing genomes of different species to understand evolutionary relationships. 

Drug discovery: Identifying potential drug targets by analyzing protein-protein interactions. 

Personalized medicine: Analyzing an individual's genetic data to tailor medical treatment. 

Microbial analysis: Studying the genomes of microorganisms to understand their functions and potential applications. 

# According to the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), bioinformatics is a subdiscipline of biology and computing that serves to acquire, store, analyse and disseminate biological data, mostly DNA and amino acid sequences.
