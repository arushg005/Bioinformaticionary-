# Basic bioinformatics terms

Alignment: Compares sequences of DNA or proteins to identify similarities 

Annotation: A collection of notes and references that describe a gene or protein 

Assembly: Groups overlapping sequences from genes that are similar or identical 

Cluster: A grouping of related objects in a multidimensional space 

Data cleaning: Uses algorithms to process experimental data and remove errors 

Mapping: Finds the location of fragments of a sequence within a reference genome 

Sequence alignment: Finds matching fragments in sequences of biopolymers 

Alternative splicing: Assembles messenger RNAs (mRNA) from a pool of exons
